There's a snake in my shoes!
=============================

This is a Snake game I made to learn Shoes and use Ruby outside of Rails. 

Special thanks go out to my little cousins for testing
the early, early versions of the game when I barely had the snake running around
and to my roommate for debugging (desnaking?) the app with me.
