There's a snake in my shoes!
================================================================================

This is a Snake game I made to learn Shoes and use Ruby outside of Rails. 

Special thanks go out to my little cousins for testing the early, early versions
of the game when I barely had the snake running around. Also to my roommate for 
debugging (desnaking?) the app with me and making me realize that I'm a dumb
programmer.

================================================================================
I hate snakes! Why does it always have to be snakes!?
================================================================================

To get it running, point your shoes binary at app.rb. This is currently tested
on Ubuntu, and I'll get around to testing it on XP and OSX soon.

More help/information on this when I get time.

================================================================================
I'm sick of these ************* snakes on this ************* plane!
================================================================================

My personal high score is 76. Then again, the game is REALLY slow by that point,
but hopefully that will be fixed in the future. If you get higher, email me a
screenshot at nick@quaran.to and perhaps I'll make a highscores file on github.
